Transcript: (00:00) In today's lesson, I'm going to teach you how to use
indirect questions confidently. Indirect questions are also called embedded
questions. Same thing. We'll go through this grammar step by step. My name's
Arnell. Let's start. Let's start with the basics. If you want to learn about
indirect questions, you have to review direct questions first. (00:29) If you're
thinking, I don't want a review. I only want to learn about indirect questions.
Skip. Skip ahead to this point here. I'll see you soon. Direct questions are
normal questions. These are the question types you first learn in English. Be as
the main verb. Remember your B forms. Are you a teacher? Is Rebecca your sister?
Was Harry angry? Were they on time? You can see be here is our main verb.
(01:15) Let's move on. Question type number two, yes questions. What are yes no
questions? Well, we expect the answer to be yes or no. How do we form a yes no
question? Auxiliary verb, subject, and then main verb. Auxiliary verbs. What are
those? Let me give you a list. Do, does, did plus subject and main verb. have,
has, had, subject plus main verb, modal verb plus subject plus main verb.
(02:04) These are the auxiliary verbs you can use. And modal verbs in English
are can, could, will, would, may, might, must, shall, and should. Examples: Do
you like it? Does she drive? Did they call? Have you finished? Has she left? Had
they arrived? Can you swim? Would you like another coffee? Should I pay now? You
can see each question has an auxiliary verb, a subject, and a main verb. (02:47)
And the answer to each of these questions can be yes or no. Do you like it? Yes
or no? Has she left? Yes or no? Okay. Technically, B questions are also yes no
questions. If I ask, are you a teacher? The answer can be yes or no. But for
today's lesson, I'm going to separate those two question types. Number three, wh
questions. (03:21) Who, what, when, where, why, how, which, how much, and how
many? Let's do some examples, of course. Who are you meeting later? What can I
do to help? When did David leave? Where should we sit? Why won't my car start?
How could my computer just shut down? Which color pen should I use? How much
money do you owe? O means need to return. (04:01) How much money do you need to
return? And how many lemons did you buy? In all of these questions, we have
question word, auxiliary verb, subject and main verb. Are these grammar rules
necessary for today's lesson? Yes, if you want to confidently use indirect
questions and avoid common mistakes, you do need to know these details, you do
need to know about direct questions. (04:34) But don't worry, as your English
improves, you won't need to think about these rules anymore. H. But what about
questions like h what smells in here? I can only see one verb and where's the
subject? In some questions, the question word is the subject. Keep this in mind.
Indirect questions. We are here. So why do we need indirect questions? What are
they for? Indirect questions are polite. (05:11) You sound nice when you use
indirect questions. Imagine you are speaking to someone you don't know. Where is
the bathroom? Could you tell me where the bathroom is? [Music] Indirect
questions sound nice. They sound polite. How do we form indirect questions?
Well, we need a question introduction. Question introduction is not official
grammar terminology. (05:47) It's my personal way of teaching. Informal means in
daily situations with people you are comfortable with. Formal means at work, in
business emails, or with people you don't know very well. You need a question
introduction and one of the question types we looked at earlier. And I have good
news. These are set phrases. (06:17) What I mean is that you need to memorize
these question introductions. Sometimes memorizing things is much better and
easier than learning rules. And these are all very common. Yep. We're going to
go through each one. And I'm going to give you lots of examples. I'm going to
start with wh questions. But first, do you want the notes for today's lesson?

An ATM is a cash machine. Indirect question. Can you tell me where I can find an
ATM? Could you tell me where I can find an ATM? Question. Introduction. Your wh
word. Subject first, then the verbs. (07:53) You can see in direct questions we
always have the verb before the subject. In indirect questions, the verb goes
after the subject like a normal sentence. Common mistake. Could you tell me
where can I find an ATM? Remember in indirect questions it's subject then verb
like a normal sentence. (08:20) If you can remember this rule, you got it. This
will be easy. Direct. Who has Ivonne spoken to? Indirect. Do you know? Do you
know who Ivonne has spoken to? Do you happen to know who Ivonne has spoken to?
Would you happen to know who Ivonne has spoken to? You can see there are lots of
possibilities and that structure never changes. (08:53) Question introduction wh
word subject then the verbs direct excuse me how do I pay for parking I don't
see a machine or any information anywhere indirect excuse me would you mind
telling me how I pay for parking and I want to clarify one thing direct
questions are not rude you can use direct questions You know, tone of voice is
often more important than grammar. (09:27) But usually when you're speaking to
someone you don't know, when you're just being polite dayto-day, indirect
questions are the better choice. H do you notice anything different about this
question? Right. Grammar rule. We do not use auxiliary verbs do, does, or did in
indirect questions. We do not say, "Would you mind telling me how I do pay for
parking?" Let's get specific. (10:01) You can see I have an asterisk by these
two questions. In English, the little star is called an asterisk. Asterisk.
asterisk. Do you have any idea? Often gives a feeling of frustration or being
annoyed. Do you have any idea what time it is? You are so late. Do you have any
idea how long I've been working on this project? You can see these people feel
either frustrated or annoyed, but not always. (10:43) Sometimes it is neutral.
Do you have any idea when Paige will be back in her office? Could you let me
know also has an asterisk. This question usually means could you tell me later.
Could you tell me when you have more information? It's not about right now.
Could you let me know when Paige is back in her office? Could you let me know
how you did on your test? These things are for the future, but here I see did.
(11:19) We can't use do, does, did, right? Here, did is the main verb, not the
auxiliary. So, it's okay. Now, these three at the bottom, you can see they're
not actually questions, but we can still use them when we are asking for
information. The same grammar rules apply. Direct. Why was my appointment
cancelled? I'd like to know why my appointment was cancelled. (11:53) I was
wondering why my appointment was cancelled. It would be helpful to know why my
appointment was cancelled. Okay, again we see that asterisk with I wonder. This
is usually a question for ourselves. We are not asking someone else for
information. I wonder who called me earlier. They didn't leave a message. H I
wonder if it's going to rain later. (12:24) I wonder how many balloons it would
take to lift me. Wh questions done. Now I'm going to do B questions and yes no
questions together because they both ask for a yes or no answer. But here the
grammar changes. It's different. Direct. Is this road closed? Could you tell me
if whether this road is closed? Question introduction. (13:03) If or whether
plus subject and then your verbs. With yes no questions, we need if or whether.
If is more common, whether is more formal, but both are fine. Direct. Was Violet
given a promotion? Do you happen to know if whether Violet was given a
promotion? Is there garlic in this sauce? Would you happen to know if there is
whether there is garlic in this sauce? Direct. (13:45) Did you receive an email
about our shifts changing? A shift is a period of time you work. Like if you
work the night shift, maybe your hours are from 7:00 p.m. to 5 a.m. I was
wondering if I was wondering whether you received an email about our shifts
changing. Will the landlord pay for the damage or will I? It would be helpful to
know if whether the landlord will pay for the damage or if I will. (14:20) Okay,
I have one final point for today. Let me bring up two examples we just looked
at. We often use whether and not together. We don't use if in this case. Do you
happen to know whether Violet was given a promotion? Do you happen to know
whether or not Violet was given a promotion? Do you happen to know whether
Violet was given a promotion or not? All three are perfect. (14:54) Original, I
was wondering whether you received an email about our shifts changing. Option
one, I was wondering whether or not you received an email about our shifts
changing. Option two, I was wondering whether you received an email about our
shift changing or not. Okay, that felt kind of long, right? Many times option
one is better for long sentences because otherwise whether or not are really far
apart. (15:29) How are you feeling? Do you feel better about indirect questions?
